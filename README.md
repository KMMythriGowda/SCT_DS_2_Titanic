# Titanic Dataset Analysis — Task 2

This repository contains my Titanic dataset analysis performed as part of my Data Science Internship.

The goal of this task is to analyze the Titanic passenger dataset, clean it, explore relationships, and visualize survival patterns.

## 📌 Objectives of the Analysis
- Load and understand the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing data (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand survival patterns based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarked port
- Visualize important insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Survival count plot (Survived vs Not Survived)
- Survival by gender
- Survival by class (Pclass)
- Age distribution
- Fare distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- Survival by Embarked port
- Survival by age groups

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Fill missing Age values using median
- Fill missing Embarked values using mode
- Drop Cabin column due to high missingness
- Convert categorical variables into usable formats

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 File Included
- **SCT_DS_2.ipynb** — Contains full code, analysis, and visualizations.

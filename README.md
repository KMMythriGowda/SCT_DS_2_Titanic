Titanic Dataset Analysis — Task 2

This repository contains my analysis of the Titanic dataset (Task 2). The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize the dataset to understand key factors influencing passenger survival.

📌 Objectives
Load and explore the Titanic dataset
Handle missing data (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
Preprocess and clean the dataset
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Identify survival patterns based on:
Gender
Passenger class
Age
Fare
Embarked port
Visualize insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

📊 Key Visualizations
Survival count plot (Survived vs Not Survived)
Survival by Gender
Survival by Passenger Class (Pclass)
Age distribution
Fare distribution
Correlation heatmap
Survival by Embarked Port
Survival by Age Groups

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Imputed missing Age values using median
Filled missing Embarked values using mode
Dropped Cabin column due to high missing values
Converted categorical variables into numeric formats where required

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Google Colab
